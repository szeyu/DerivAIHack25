Deriv &lt;AI> 25 Hackathon

## Docker Setup
1. Install docker desktop from the links provided [Docker Desktop Installation](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

2. Under each services(frontend && backend) folder, you could refer to respective `README.md` and `makefile` to execute the services seperately.

3. To run both services(frontend && backend) together, we could utilise the makefile recipe.
    - docker-build: Allow you to build and run both services that defined in a Docker Compose file.
    - docker-down: Allow you to stop and remove all containers defined in a Docker Compose file.
